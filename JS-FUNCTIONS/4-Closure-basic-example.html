        > JS considers Functions as first class citizens because they can accept functions as argument( callback ) and they can also return a function


    Closure in action - invoke inner() inside outer :  ƒ 
    -----------------------------------------------------

        function outer(){
            function inner() {
                console.log(`Hello there secret is : `);
              }
            inner()
        }

        invoke outer :  ƒ

            outer() 
        
        logs Hello there secret is :

    Make this even more interesting by returning inner function
    -----------------------------------------------------------
        > We can do way more interesting things by assigning it into a variable and then invoking it or invoking the function itself again
    
            function outer(){
                function inner() {
                    console.log(`Hello there secret is : `);
                }
                return inner
            }
    
        > most cases assigned to a variable

            const value = outer() 
            console.log(value);

        > The above logs
                ƒ inner() {
                console.log(`Hello there secret is : `);
            }
    
        > And therefore if we have assigned to a variable, we can invoke it 
            value()

        > logs in the console
            Hello there secret is :
        
        > Idearly this should be the same as 
            (ƒ inner() {
                console.log(`Hello there secret is : `);
            })()

        > OR invoke outer again - would mean the same thing
         
            outer()()

     Variables inside function are not accessible from outside
    -----------------------------------------------------------
         > Declare privateVar variable inside inner : ƒ 

            function outer() {
                let privateVar = 'secret'
                
                function inner() {
                    console.log(`Hello there secret is : `);
                }
                return inner
            }
    
         > We cannot access private variable from outside 
            console.log(privateVar)

        > However , we can access access privateVar within the inner : ƒ because it is within the scope of the outer : ƒ 

            function outer() {
                let privateVar = 'secret'
                
                function inner() {
                    console.log(`Hello there secret is : ${privateVar}`);
                }
                return inner
            }

        > Now what really is mind blowing is the fact that privateVar is accessible to inner : ƒ even once we have invoked the outer

             outer()()
        > We still have access to it
        
        > What we can do is setup all kind of functionality in the outer: ƒ and then depending on what we would want to allow control from the outside returned with that function

// What is really cool is that we can setup some other instances as well
// For each and every instance we create, the showBalance remembers what was the value when the newAccount was invoked

const stabilo = newAccount('Stabilo', 10000)
const asabe = newAccount('Asabe', 5000)

// And then invoke both of them as well
    stabilo()
    asabe()

// True beauty of the closure is that it always remembers the value when every time the newAccount is invoked
