        > JS considers Functions as first class citizens because they can accept functions as argument( callback ) and they can also return a function


    Closure in action - invoke inner() inside outer :  ƒ 
    -----------------------------------------------------

        function outer(){
            function inner() {
                console.log(`Hello there secret is : `);
              }
            inner()
        }

        invoke outer :  ƒ

            outer() 
        
        logs Hello there secret is :

    Make this even more interesting by returning inner function
    -----------------------------------------------------------
        > We can do way more interesting things by assigning it into a variable and then invoking it or invoking the function itself again
    
            function outer(){
                function inner() {
                    console.log(`Hello there secret is : `);
                }
                return inner
            }
    
        > most cases assigned to a variable

            const value = outer() 
            console.log(value);

        > The above logs
                ƒ inner() {
                console.log(`Hello there secret is : `);
            }
    
        > And therefore if we have assigned to a variable, we can invoke it 
            value()

        > logs in the console
            Hello there secret is :
        
        > Idearly this should be the same as 
            (ƒ inner() {
                console.log(`Hello there secret is : `);
            })()

        > OR invoke outer again - would mean the same thing
         
            outer()()

     Variables inside function are not accessible from outside
    -----------------------------------------------------------
         > Declare privateVar variable inside inner : ƒ 

            function outer() {
                let privateVar = 'secret'
                
                function inner() {
                    console.log(`Hello there secret is : `);
                }
                return inner
            }
    
         > We cannot access private variable from outside 
            console.log(privateVar)

        > However , we can access access privateVar within the inner : ƒ because it is within the scope of the outer : ƒ 

            function outer() {
                let privateVar = 'secret'
                
                function inner() {
                    console.log(`Hello there secret is : ${privateVar}`);
                }
                return inner
            }

        > Now what really is mind blowing is the fact that privateVar is accessible to inner : ƒ even once we have invoked the outer

             outer()()
        > We still have access to it
        
        > What we can do is setup all kind of functionality in the outer: ƒ and then depending on what we would want to allow control from the outside returned with that function
*/

// Returns an object instead
// showBalance: ƒ becomes now a method and we can use (.)operator to access it when we are assigning it into a variable

// This even gives us more functionality .i.e deposit and withdraw

    function newAccount(name, initialBalance) {

        let balance = initialBalance;

        // show balance
        function showBalance() {
            console.log(`Hey ${name}, your balance is ${balance}`);
        }

        // deposit money
        // update Balance - call showBalance() because we have access to it
        function deposit(amount){
            balance = balance + amount
            showBalance()
        }

        // withdraw money
        // check if the amount we are withdrawing is bigger than the balance - tell the user they have insufficient funds
        //if the condition is false, then update showBalance() with the correct balance after withdrawal
        function withdraw(amount){
            if(amount > balance){
                console.log(`Hey ${name}, insufficient funds in your account`);
                return
            }
            balance = balance - amount
            showBalance()
        }

        // return them as an object with 3 methods
        return {
            showBalance : showBalance,
            deposit : deposit,
            withdraw : withdraw
        }
    }

    // john creates new account with a min balance of 1000
    const john = newAccount('john', 1000);
    const bob = newAccount('bob',1000)
    
    john.showBalance();
    john.deposit(400);
    john.deposit(1000)
    john.balance = 10000;
    john.withdraw(400)
    john.withdraw(2001)


    console.log('------------------------------------');

    // and of course we can do that with Bob or any other instance we are going to create
    bob.showBalance();


// AND WHAT IS REALLY POWERFUL IS THAT NO ONE (balance cannot be accessed outside the newAccount : ƒ ) THEY CAN ONLY ACCESS THIS WITH THE METHODS THAT WE DESIGN
// THE DEPOSIT/WITHDARWALS AND SHOW BALANCE

// Even if we do john.balance = 10000; - This is not gonna work even if we do it before withdrawals
// Because we cannot control the balance , we did not set it up on our API / object that we are returning
// We only show the methods available
// We are not giving anyone access to the balance

// They have only access to the balance once they setup the account and once they use our design methods ( showBalance / deposit / withdraw )
