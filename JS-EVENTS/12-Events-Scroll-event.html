    ----------------

        > scrollY
            - returns the number of pixels the document is currently scrolled along the vertical-axis

            - also known as pageYOffset

        > scrollX
            - returns the number of pixels the document is currently scrolled along the horizontal-axis

            - also known as pageXOffset

        > Both scrollY and scrollX are available on the window object

    N/B:
        > pageYOffset and pageXOffset are deprecated

// scroll event in action
//If we want to know how many pixels we have scrolled either vertically/horizontally then scrollY and scrollX will give us that info

        console.log(window.scrollY + 'px');
        console.log(window.scrollX + 'px');
